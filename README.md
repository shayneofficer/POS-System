This app is designed to be a restaurant POS system. The app was developed to improve upon some of the "pain points that restaurants typically have with their POS systems. The Webster Halsted POS system combines a consumer facing view in which consumers can search for restaurants, view the restaurant menu and make a reservation. There is also a login view which was created specifically for the front of house restaurant staff. This view has 3 different access levels: manager, host and server. The server is able to change the table status, enter the tables order, get the check for the customer and even split the bill if the party desires to have split checks. The host and manager are able to view upcoming reservations and assign servers to tables.
